My name is Lance Arlaus. I am a well-rounded technologist living in the NYC metro area.  
I am a Manager, a Developer, and an Agile Coach with business acumen and technology insight.  
I thoroughly enjoy architecting software systems and leading talented software development teams working on interesting problems.  

This is my tech blog, which I update from time to time when I get the time.
